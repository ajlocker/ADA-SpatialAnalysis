##Preliminaries
Load and install the following packages: {sf}, {raster}, {tmap}

##Objectives

##Loading GIS Data into R

##Point Pattern Analysis

##Density Mapping

##Overlaying Maps and Creating 3D Maps

##3D Plotting to Visualize Data

#Load in the packages

```{r}
library(raster)
library(mapmate)
library(dplyr)
library(geosphere)
library(data.table)
library("parallel")
library(purrr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(classInt)

#Load in the raster data
marble <- raster("BlackMarble_2016_3km_geo.tif")

#Simplify the raster - to test this out I would set the value at 50+
marble <- aggregate(marble, 10)

#Extact the values and coordinates from the raster grid - this is what is passed onto ggplot2.
marble.pts <- rasterToPoints(marble, spatial=T)
marble.pts@data <- data.frame(marble.pts@data, long=coordinates(marble.pts)[,1],lat=coordinates(marble.pts)[,2]) 
names(marble.pts@data)<- c("z","lon","lat")

#Convert to the tidyverse, required for mappmate.
marble.dat <- as_data_frame(marble.pts@data)

#We aren't plotting the image colours - rather a series of rectangles to be coloured by the pixel value. The range of colours needs to be specified. For this I have extraced the main colours from NASA's image and approximately aligned them to their corresponding values. This is seen the colour palette below that gets fed into the map.
pal <- colorRampPalette(c("#0b0c1a","#1e1c37","#202144","#2b3355","#7f6e61","#d0b695","#efd7af", "#fefbe6"), bias=2.75)
n<-30

#some more magic here - see the vignette I link to above.
marble.frame <- map(1:n, ~mutate(marble.dat, frameID = .x))
rng <- range(marble.dat$z, na.rm=TRUE)
file <- "3D_rotating_simp"
id <- "frameID"

#OK - here goes! You need the parallel package up and running - mc.cores specifies how many processors to use. You can see I used 30 but this can obviously be less.

mclapply(marble.frame, save_map,z.name="z", id=id, lon=0, lat=0, n.period=30, n.frames=n, col=pal(5000), type="maptiles", file=file, z.range=rng,png.args = list(width = 30, 
        height = 30, res = 300, bg = "transparent", units="cm"),rotation.axis = 0,mc.cores=30)
```
